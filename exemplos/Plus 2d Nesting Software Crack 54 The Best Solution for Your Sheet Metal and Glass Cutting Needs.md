# How to Optimize Your Cutting Layouts with Plus 2D Nesting Software 54
 
If you are looking for a way to reduce scrap and improve efficiency in your cutting processes, you might want to consider using Plus 2D Nesting Software 54. This is a state of the art nesting software that can generate optimized layouts for 2 dimensional rectangular cutting in various industries, such as glass, sheet metal, wood, building panel, carpet, PCB, acrylics and more[^1^] [^2^].
 
Plus 2D Nesting Software 54 can handle multiple stocks in a single job, including sheets and coils (rolls). It can also support non-rectangular parts through DXF import, parametric part library and standard shapes. You can also create part assemblies and use standard material library. The software allows you to control the cut complexity, saw blade thickness or kerf, speed and optimization level. It also has sophisticated algorithms that consistently generate high utilization layouts with minimum waste[^2^].

Plus 2D Nesting Software 54 can also link to CNC machines and controllers, and export the layout drawings as DXF with information on different layers. It can also write out the data in standard formats. You can also generate custom labels, integrated with Microsoft Word. The software provides you with summary and detailed reports with layout drawings, cut sequence and cutting instructions. You can also simulate the cutting process and re-nest the remaining problem if needed[^2^].
 
Plus 2D Nesting Software 54 has some optional add-on modules that can enhance its functionality. For example, you can use the large parts with joints module to cut parts that are larger than the stock size. You can also use the ring optimization module to optimize circular parts. You can also use the NC code generation module to generate NC code for CNC machines. You can also use the bar coded labels module to print bar codes for each part[^2^].
