# The Gendered Society Reader: A Collection of Essays on Gender and Society
 
The Gendered Society Reader is a book that compiles various essays on gender and society from different disciplines and perspectives. The book aims to answer some of the most fundamental questions about gender, such as: How are men and women different? Why is every society based on male domination? How does gender shape various aspects of our lives, such as family, work, education, religion, and sexuality?
 
The book is divided into seven parts, each focusing on a different theme or issue related to gender. The first part explores the biological arguments about gender differences, such as evolutionary psychology, testosterone, and brain structure. The second part examines the cultural construction of gender, such as how different societies define and celebrate gender roles and identities. The third part analyzes the psychology of sex roles, such as how gender stereotypes affect our behavior, emotions, and self-concept. The fourth part discusses the social construction of gender relations, such as how gender is performed and negotiated in everyday interactions. The fifth part looks at the gendered family, such as how marriage, parenthood, and domestic work are influenced by gender norms and expectations. The sixth part investigates the gendered classroom, such as how gender affects students' learning, participation, and achievement in school. The seventh part explores the gender of religion, such as how religious beliefs and practices reinforce or challenge gender inequalities.
