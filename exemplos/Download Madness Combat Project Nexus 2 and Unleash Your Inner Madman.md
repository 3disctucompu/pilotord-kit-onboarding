## What is Madness Combat Project Nexus 2?
  
Madness Combat Project Nexus 2 is a game developed by GIBBING TREE, LLC, a team composed of Matt Jolly and Michael Swain, two smalltime game developers who spent seven years bringing this project to life. It was inspired by their love for the side-scrolling button mashers they grew up with, such as Smash TV, Final Fight, and Castle Crashers[^1^].
  
The game is set in the Madness universe, a dark and violent world where you can shoot, stab, bash, chop, and slaughter your way through over 16 hours of intense combat. Your wits will be challenged, your nerves will be tested, and blood will probably get all over everything[^1^]. But that's alright. Wading through the dismembered remnants of those who fell to your bullets and steel, only one thing crosses your mind: They asked for this. And you're glad that they did.

## What are the Features and Modes of Madness Combat Project Nexus 2?
  
Madness Combat Project Nexus 2 offers three main modes of gameplay: Story Mode, Arena Mode, and Zed Survival Mode[^2^].
  
- **Story Mode**: Take the reigns of the heroes of the Madness universe, and infiltrate heavily guarded installations, survive cultist-ridden tunnel networks, fight back against dynamite-wielding cannibal bandits, and dodge the grasp of armor-plated Mag Agents over three times your size...all while unearthing the terrible secrets of Project Nexus itself. Play solo or locally with up to three other people (using Xbox-compatible controllers)[^1^].
- **Arena Mode**: Create your character from scratch, advance through specialized skill tiers, and build a unique Madness warrior who is equipped to take on wave after wave of never-ending badguys in a closed combat environment. Build your own custom weapons and outfit them with the latest technology to give yourself the edge you're going to need to survive[^1^].
- **Zed Survival Mode**: Our randomized, roguelike survival game! Form a lone band of zombie apocalypse survivors with specialized party roles and skillsets to match. Each will have his or her own unique personality traits to determine what will drive them toward insanity or keep them sane for one more night in the zombie-infested wastelands of the Madness world. Scavenge for supplies and arm your team to the teeth, because there're more dangerous things out there than bandits and zombies[^2^]...
