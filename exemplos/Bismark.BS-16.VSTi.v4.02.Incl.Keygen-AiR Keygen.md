Bismark BS-16 is designed to be simple and easy to use, with an intuitive user interface that lets you adjust the parameters of each channel and soundfont. You can also change the program and bank of each channel by hand or by MIDI messages, and set any channel to be a drum channel. The plugin responds to MIDI CCs and Roland GS format NRPN/Control Change messages for more control over the sound[^1^].
 
The latest version of Bismark BS-16 is v4.02, which was released in 2010. It fixed some bugs and improved the compatibility with some hosts and soundfonts. You can download a demo version of the plugin from the official website of Bismark, or purchase the full version for $30 USD. The full version comes with a keygen that generates a license key for the plugin[^2^]. However, please note that using a keygen is illegal and unethical, as it violates the terms of service of the software developer. Therefore, we do not recommend or endorse using a keygen to activate Bismark BS-16 or any other software.
