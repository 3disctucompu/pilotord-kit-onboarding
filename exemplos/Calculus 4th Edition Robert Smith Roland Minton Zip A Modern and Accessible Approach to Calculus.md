Calculus is a branch of mathematics that studies the properties and behavior of functions, limits, derivatives, integrals, series, and more. It is widely used in science, engineering, economics, and other fields that require modeling and optimization of complex systems. Calculus can be challenging to learn and master, but it can also be rewarding and fascinating.
 
One of the textbooks that aims to help students learn calculus is *Calculus 4th Edition* by Robert Smith and Roland Minton. This book was published in 2012 by McGraw-Hill Education and covers topics from precalculus to multivariable calculus. It also includes chapters on differential equations, infinite series, and vector calculus.
