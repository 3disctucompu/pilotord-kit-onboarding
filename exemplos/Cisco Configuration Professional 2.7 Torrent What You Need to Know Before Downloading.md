If you are looking for a graphical user interface (GUI) tool to manage your Cisco access routers, you might want to check out Cisco Configuration Professional 2.7 (CCP). CCP is a device management tool that simplifies router, firewall, intrusion prevention system (IPS), VPN, Unified Communications, WAN, and LAN configuration with easy-to-use wizards. It also offers features such as one-click router lockdown, voice and security auditing, router status monitoring, and WAN and VPN troubleshooting.
 
CCP is the latest desktop version of the tool as Cisco is no longer publishing newer versions. It is available for Windows, MacOS and Linux platforms. You can download it from Firewall.cx's Cisco Tools & Applications download section[^1^]. However, you should be aware that downloading software from unofficial sources may pose security risks and violate intellectual property rights. Therefore, it is recommended that you obtain CCP from Cisco's official website or authorized resellers.
