XML is widely used in many domains and applications, such as web development, e-commerce, content management, data exchange, and more. XML can also work with other technologies, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Java, and .NET. By using XML, you can create dynamic and interactive web pages that display data from various sources.
 
XML is also a standard format for web services, which are software components that communicate over the internet using standardized protocols. Web services can provide various functionalities, such as searching, booking, ordering, and more. By using XML, you can create and consume web services that are platform-independent and interoperable.

Here is another paragraph for the article:
 
To learn XML, you need to understand its syntax and rules, such as how to write tags, attributes, comments, entities, and declarations. You also need to know how to use DTDs and schemas to define and validate the structure and content of your XML documents. DTDs and schemas can also help you avoid errors and inconsistencies in your XML data.
 
Another important aspect of XML is how to transform and manipulate it using XSLT and XPath. XSLT is a language that lets you apply rules and templates to transform XML documents into other formats, such as HTML, text, or other XML documents. XPath is a language that lets you select and extract specific parts of an XML document based on their location and attributes.
