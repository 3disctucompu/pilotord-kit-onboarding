# How to Reset Samsung ML-1640 Toner Cartridge
 
If you have a Samsung ML-1640 laser printer with the starter toner cartridge (that was in it when you bought it), you may encounter a problem when you try to refill it or replace it with a non-original cartridge. The printer may stop working and display a "Toner Exhausted" message on the red LED. This is because the toner cartridge has reached its maximum page count and needs to be reset.

There are different methods to reset the toner cartridge, depending on whether it has a chip or not. The starter cartridge does not have a chip, so you cannot reset it by shorting two pins on the chip. However, you can try the following steps to reset it:
 
1. Turn off the printer and disconnect the power cord.
2. Open the front cover and remove the toner cartridge.
3. On the back of the toner cartridge, you will see three metal contacts. Cover them with a piece of tape or paper.
4. Reinsert the toner cartridge and close the front cover.
5. Reconnect the power cord and turn on the printer.
6. The printer should recognize the toner cartridge as a new one and reset the page count.
7. Print a test page to check if the toner level is correct.
8. If everything works fine, you can remove the tape or paper from the metal contacts.

This method may not work for all versions of firmware or toner cartridges. If it does not work for you, you may need to update your firmware or buy a new toner cartridge with a chip that can be reset. You can find more information about these methods on the web[^1^] [^2^] [^3^].

Why do you need to reset the toner cartridge? The toner cartridge is a consumable part of the printer that contains the toner powder that is used to print on the paper. The toner cartridge has a limited lifespan and can print a certain number of pages before it runs out of toner. The printer monitors the toner level and displays a warning message when the toner is low or empty.
 
However, sometimes the printer may not accurately detect the toner level, especially if you refill the toner cartridge or use a non-original cartridge. This may cause the printer to stop working prematurely or print poor quality pages. To fix this problem, you need to reset the toner cartridge so that the printer can recognize it as a new one and reset the page count.
 
Resetting the toner cartridge can save you money and reduce waste by extending the life of your toner cartridge. However, you should be careful not to overuse the toner cartridge or damage it by refilling it improperly. You should also check the print quality regularly and replace the toner cartridge when it is worn out or defective.

How to refill the toner cartridge? If you want to refill the toner cartridge yourself, you need to buy a toner refill kit that is compatible with your printer model. The toner refill kit usually contains a bottle of toner powder, a syringe, a funnel, and instructions. You can follow these steps to refill the toner cartridge:

1. Shake the bottle of toner powder well before opening it.
2. Remove the toner cartridge from the printer and place it on a flat surface.
3. Locate the fill hole on the side of the toner cartridge. It may be covered by a plastic plug or a label. Remove the plug or peel off the label.
4. Insert the funnel into the fill hole and pour the toner powder slowly and evenly into the toner cartridge. Do not overfill the toner cartridge or spill the toner powder.
5. Remove the funnel and seal the fill hole with a new plug or tape.
6. Clean any excess toner powder from the outside of the toner cartridge.
7. Reinstall the toner cartridge into the printer and reset it as described above.

Refilling the toner cartridge can be messy and hazardous. You should wear gloves and a mask to avoid inhaling or touching the toner powder. You should also work in a well-ventilated area and dispose of the empty bottle and syringe properly. Do not reuse the bottle or syringe for other purposes.
