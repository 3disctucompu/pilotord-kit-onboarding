The plot of **Case DÃ©part** follows two half-brothers, JoÃ«l and RÃ©gis, who have nothing in common except their father, a former slave from the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe. JoÃ«l is a rebellious and unemployed black activist who blames white people for all his problems, while RÃ©gis is a successful and assimilated black lawyer who denies his African roots and despises his brother.
 
When their father dies, they inherit a document that proves their ancestor was a free man who fought alongside Toussaint Louverture, the leader of the Haitian Revolution. However, they also learn that they have to travel to Guadeloupe and return the document to the local museum within 48 hours, or they will lose their inheritance.
 
On their way to the airport, they encounter a mysterious old woman who curses them and sends them back in time to 1780, at the height of slavery in the French colonies. There, they are captured and sold as slaves to a cruel plantation owner. They soon realize that they have to escape from their fate and find a way to return to the present. Along the way, they will face many challenges and adventures, as well as learn more about their history and identity.
