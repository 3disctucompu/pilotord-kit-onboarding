The game offers various modes of play, such as single race, championship, career, and multiplayer. In single race mode, the player can choose any rider, stadium, and difficulty level and compete in a four-lap race against three opponents. In championship mode, the player can participate in the entire 2005 season, earning points and ranking based on their performance. In career mode, the player can create their own rider and start from the bottom of the ladder, signing contracts with different teams, upgrading their bike, and challenging other riders. In multiplayer mode, up to four players can race against each other online or on a local network.
 
The game features realistic physics and graphics, as well as dynamic weather and track conditions that affect the gameplay. The game also includes a track editor that allows the player to create their own custom tracks and share them with other players. The game received positive reviews from critics and fans of speedway, who praised its authenticity, gameplay, and replay value.
 
However, some players may have encountered difficulties in running the game on newer versions of Windows or may have wanted to play the game without inserting the CD-ROM every time. For those players, there is a solution: a crack file that bypasses the copy protection and allows the game to run smoothly on any system. The crack file can be downloaded from various websites, such as Chomikuj.pl, a popular Polish file-sharing service. However, downloading and using the crack file may be illegal in some countries and may expose the user to viruses or malware. Therefore, it is advisable to use the crack file at your own risk and only if you own a legal copy of the game.
