Spinal fractures are not very common, but they can have serious consequences. According to the Cleveland Clinic, spinal fractures affect about 700,000 people in the United States each year. Most of them are caused by osteoporosis, a condition that weakens the bones and makes them more prone to breaking. Other causes include falls, sports injuries, car accidents and violence. Spinal fractures can range from mild to severe, depending on the location and extent of the damage. Some spinal fractures can heal with conservative treatments such as braces, pain medication and physical therapy. Others may require surgery to stabilize the spine and prevent further complications.
 
Music is a powerful form of expression that can help people cope with their emotions and trauma. Many artists have written songs inspired by their personal injuries or illnesses, such as Eminem's "Not Afraid", which talks about his recovery from drug addiction; Lady Gaga's "Til It Happens To You", which addresses her experience of sexual assault; and Ed Sheeran's "Photograph", which was written after he broke his arm in a bike accident. These songs can resonate with listeners who have gone through similar situations and offer them comfort and hope.
