Lepton Armarius 3D is a software system that allows you to design and produce any kind of furniture, from kitchens and closets to architectural elements and partitions. It is a leader in the development of software for the furniture and aluminum enclosures sector[^1^].
 
With Lepton Armarius 3D, you can create realistic 3D models of your furniture, customize every parameter, and obtain automatic cutting lists, costs, manufacturing orders, and budgets for your clients. You can also export your designs to CNC machines for precise fabrication[^1^].

Lepton Armarius 3D is easy and intuitive to use, and does not require a CAD platform. It guides you step by step through different windows, where you can select and modify the design options. You can also edit your design from the 3D visualization, changing dimensions, textures, edge bandings, location, rotation, and more[^1^].

Lepton Armarius 3D also creates realistic photos (renders) of your furniture, with effects such as reflections, illuminations, transparencies, and textures. You can show your clients the outcome of your design with an excellent final quality. You can also use the interactive visualization tool to view your furniture from any angle and viewpoint with textures, in real time and with a 3D sensation[^1^].
 
Lepton Armarius 3D has two versions: Design version and Factory version. The Design version allows you to design and present your furniture projects. The Factory version is the systemâs full version, that allows designing, cutting up and optimizing materials for production[^1^].
 
If you are looking for a powerful software for furniture design and production, Lepton Armarius 3D is the best option for you. You can download it from [here](http://www.lepton.com.ar/index.php/en/productos-lepton/lepton-sistemas/lepton-armarius.html) or contact us for more information.
  
Lepton Armarius 3D is not only a software for furniture design and production, but also a tool for creativity and innovation. You can use it to create unique and original furniture projects, that suit your clients' needs and preferences. You can also explore different styles, materials, colors, and finishes, and see how they look in 3D before making any decision.
 
Lepton Armarius 3D is compatible with other Lepton software systems, such as Lepton Optimizer, Lepton Winmaker, Lepton Tabmaker, Lepton Focus 3D, and Lepton G-Cad and G-Plus. These systems are specialized in different aspects of the furniture and aluminum enclosures sector, such as cutting optimization, calculation of openings, design and production of partitions, and CAD-CAM for CNC machines. You can integrate them with Lepton Armarius 3D to achieve a complete and efficient solution for your business.
 
Lepton Armarius 3D is also supported by a team of professionals who offer training, tutorials, technical support, and customer service. You can access these services through the Lepton website or by contacting us directly. We are always ready to help you and answer your questions.
 
Lepton Armarius 3D is more than a software. It is a partner for your success. Try it today and discover its benefits.
