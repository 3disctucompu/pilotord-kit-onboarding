The new versions of Si9000 and Si8000 offer several enhancements and bug fixes, such as:
 
- Improved accuracy and speed for differential impedance calculations
- Support for more PCB stackup configurations and materials
- Improved user interface and documentation
- Compatibility with Windows 10 and 64-bit systems

The Si9000 and Si8000 software are part of Polar's suite of tools for PCB design and test, which also includes the Speedstack PCB stackup design system, the Atlas controlled impedance test system, the Toneohm 950 short circuit locator, and the CGen coupon generator. These tools help PCB designers and manufacturers to optimize the performance, reliability, and cost of their products.
 
The new versions of Si9000 and Si8000 are available for download from Polar's website. Users who have a valid maintenance contract can upgrade to the new versions for free.

Polar Instruments is a global leader in the field of high-speed PCB design and test. Founded in 1976, Polar has offices and distributors in Europe, North America, Asia, and Australia. Polar's products are used by thousands of customers worldwide, including major electronics companies, contract manufacturers, and PCB fabricators. Polar's mission is to provide innovative and reliable solutions that help customers to achieve their design and quality goals.
 
Polar's Si9000 and Si8000 software are based on the boundary element method (BEM), a numerical technique that solves Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic fields. The BEM approach allows for accurate modeling of complex geometries and materials, such as non-uniform cross-sections, surface roughness, frequency-dependent dielectrics, and anisotropic substrates. The Si9000 and Si8000 software can calculate single-ended and differential impedance, insertion loss, return loss, crosstalk, propagation delay, and other parameters for a wide range of transmission line structures, such as microstrip, stripline, coplanar waveguide, differential pair, edge-coupled pair, broadside-coupled pair, and more.
 
The Si9000 and Si8000 software are easy to use and integrate with other PCB design tools. Users can import and export data in various formats, such as Touchstone, ODB++, IPC-2581, HyperLynx, Cadence Allegro, Mentor Graphics PADS, Zuken CR-8000, and more. Users can also create custom reports and graphs to visualize and compare the results. The Si9000 and Si8000 software are compatible with Windows 7, 8.1, and 10 operating systems.
