However, if you want to use the full features of this software, you will need to purchase a license key that costs $199 for a single user. Alternatively, you can try to use a keygen generator that can generate a valid license key for free. A keygen generator is a program that can create serial numbers or activation codes for various software applications. However, using a keygen generator is illegal and risky, as it may contain malware or viruses that can harm your computer or compromise your data.
 
Therefore, we do not recommend using a keygen generator for JVSG IP Video System Design Tool or any other software. Instead, you should buy a legitimate license key from the official website of JVSG or use the free trial version of the software that allows you to test its features for 45 days. By doing so, you will support the developers of this software and avoid any legal or security issues.

In this article, we will show you how to use JVSG IP Video System Design Tool to design a video surveillance system for your home or business. We will also explain some of the features and benefits of this software and how it can help you save time and money.
 
The first step is to download and install JVSG IP Video System Design Tool from the official website. You can choose between the Windows or Mac version depending on your operating system. After installing the software, you will need to enter your license key or activate the free trial version. You can also check for updates and download the latest version of the software if available.
 
The next step is to create a new project and enter some basic information about your video surveillance system, such as the name, location, description, and date. You can also choose the units of measurement, the currency, and the language for your project. Then, you can start designing your video surveillance system by adding cameras, lenses, cables, monitors, recorders, switches, routers, and other components. You can drag and drop these components from the library or import them from a file.

To add cameras to your project, you can either use the auto-placement feature or manually place them on the floor plan. The auto-placement feature will automatically calculate the optimal number and position of cameras based on your requirements, such as the coverage area, the resolution, the frame rate, and the compression. You can also adjust the parameters and preferences of the auto-placement feature to suit your needs.

If you want to manually place cameras on the floor plan, you can select a camera from the library and drag it to the desired location. You can also rotate, resize, and move the camera using the mouse or the keyboard. You can also edit the camera settings, such as the name, the model, the lens type, the focal length, the iris, the exposure, the white balance, the backlight compensation, and the noise reduction. You can also enable or disable features such as motion detection, face recognition, license plate recognition, and audio recording.
 
After placing cameras on the floor plan, you can view the 3D model of your system by clicking on the 3D button. You can also switch between different views, such as top view, front view, side view, perspective view, and camera view. You can also zoom in and out, pan, rotate, and tilt the 3D model using the mouse or the keyboard. You can also change the lighting conditions, such as day or night, sunny or cloudy, indoor or outdoor. You can also simulate different scenarios, such as people walking or cars driving.
