Stalker Call Of Pripyat is a first-person shooter game set in the post-apocalyptic Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. The game features a nonlinear storyline, realistic graphics, and immersive gameplay. However, some players may find the game too challenging or want to experiment with different options. That's where console commands come in handy.
 
Console commands are special codes that you can type in the game's console to activate various effects, such as changing the weather, spawning items, or modifying your character's stats. One of the most useful console commands is money, which allows you to add or subtract money from your inventory. This can help you buy better weapons, armor, and supplies from traders or upgrade your equipment at technicians.
