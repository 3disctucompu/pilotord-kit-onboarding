1. First, you need to install The Sims 3 BASE GAME from the original disc or a downloaded file. After the installation is complete, copy the crack file from the crack folder and paste it in the bin folder of the base game directory (usually C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\Bin). Replace the existing file if prompted. Then, run the game and check if it works properly.
2. Next, you need to install the most recent expansion pack, which is The Sims 3: Into The Future. You can install it from the disc or a downloaded file as well. After the installation is complete, copy the crack file from the crack folder of this expansion and paste it in the same bin folder of the base game directory as before. Replace the existing file if prompted. Then, run the game and check if it works properly. Note that you should always use this crack file to enter the game, regardless of which expansion you want to play.
3. Finally, you can install any other expansion packs that you want, in any order. You do not need to crack these expansions, just install them normally and then run the game using the crack file from The Sims 3: Into The Future. You should be able to play all of the expansions without any problems.

Enjoy your game!
